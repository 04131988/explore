The **OpenAPI Specification** (OAS), previously known as the **Swagger Specification**, is a specification for a programming language-agnostic, machine-readable interface definition language for describing, producing, consuming and visualizing web services. OpenAPI documents describe API services and are represented in YAML or JSON formats.

# Advantages of Using OpenAPI
* **Description Validation and Linting**: Check that your description file is syntactically correct and adheres to a specific version of the Specification and the rest of your teamâ€™s formatting guidelines.
* **Data Validation**: Check that the data flowing through your API (in both directions) is correct, during development and once deployed.
* **Documentation Generation**: Create traditional human-readable documentation based on the machine-readable description, which always stays up-to-date.
* **Code Generation**: Create both server and client code in any programming language, freeing developers from having to perform data validation or write SDK glue code, for example.
* **Graphical Editors**: Allow easy creation of description files using a GUI instead of typing them by hand.
* **Mock Servers**: Create fake servers providing example responses which you and your customers can start testing with before you write a single line of code.
* **Security Analysis**: Discover possible vulnerabilities at the API design stage instead of much, much later.
* A non-proprietary format
