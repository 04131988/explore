**Jamstack** (previously stylized as **JAMStack**) is a web development architecture pattern and solution stack, in other words, a way of thinking about how to build for the web: the UI is compiled, the frontend is fully decoupled, and data is pulled in as needed. The acronym "JAM" stands for JavaScript, API and Markup (generated by a [static site generator](/topics/ssg)).
