**Inversion of control** (**IoC**) is a design pattern in which custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. This pattern is about providing any kind of callback, which "implements" and/or controls reaction, instead of acting oneself directly (in other words, inversion and/or redirecting control to the external handler/controller). The term "inversion" is historical: a software architecture with this design "inverts" control as compared to procedural programming. In procedural programming, a program's custom code calls reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls the custom code.
